Hello sir, 
          I have put all the graph functions in graph.h and main function is in graph.c
bfs and dfs traversals uses stack and queue, while stack and queue uses singly linked list so the sll.h,stack.h,queue.h files are needed.

         make graph


[2]====> To run the code use following command:
         make run
