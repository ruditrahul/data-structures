Hello sir,
I have written makefile with labels for singly LL ,doubly LL ,stack ,queue


1) For Singly Linked list there are two files 
   sll.h and sllmain.c
   
   to compile ==> make sll
   to run     ==> ./sll


2) For Doubly Linked list there are two files 
   dll.h and dllmain.c
   
   to compile ==> make dll
   to run     ==> ./dll


3) For Stack there are three files 
    sll,stack.h and stackmain.c
   
   to compile ==> make stack
   to run     ==> ./stack


4) For queue there are four files 
   sll.h,stack.h,queue.h and queuemain.c
   
   to compile ==> make queue
   to run     ==> ./queue


Please suggest if any improvement needed in codes
Thank You sir.
